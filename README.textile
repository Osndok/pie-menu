h1. Java Swing Pie Menus

This project is currently INCOMPLETE or UNUSABLE... but getting pretty close!

It's motivation comes from seeing so many various 'proof-of-concept' pie menus that either (1) greatly favor asethetics over functionality, or (2) don't actually have the hooks that would be required to (in fact) *use* them when building another application... which makes them little more than toys.

Therefore, this project is an attempt to create a mostly-compliant swing component (i.e. that behaves as a GUI designer would expect) that might be a "drop in replacement" or an "easy add" for contextual menus.

h2. Lacking features that prevent usability

* investigate/transition PieMenu's base class from JList to JPopupMenu
** early experiment shows it might be hard to override the UI to that degree
** investigate/transition PieMenuEntry's base class to JMenuItem

* Upon moving a mouse over a wedge
** highlight that wedge somehow
** store the selected state (ala JList/JPopupMenu, fire triggers, etc)

* Upon moving a mouse over the center hub
** deselect currently-selected wedge
** make JList/JPopupMenu selection null

* Support 'seperators'
